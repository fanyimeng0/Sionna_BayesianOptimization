# Sionna_BayesianOptimization
As discussed in the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11103, Gradient descent algorithm may not produce best results for Optimization of Transmitter Orientation if number of transmittors are more than one. 
This notebook implements Bayesian Optimization (https://github.com/bayesian-optimization/BayesianOptimization/) to optimize Transmitter Orientation for best bit rate and SINR for a given region. Please follow the notebook comments. I will try to improve the documentation in future.
